They are also getting accustomed to “consuming” online and spending their leisure time online in things that interest them. Shaale’s Live service lets traditional art forms reach people where they like to spend their time. By utilizing the latest digital platforms, you can redefine how audiences relate to live performances.</li>\\n              <li>To help geographically distant people who are interested in your event to access and experience it: Live streaming allows you to connect geographically dispersed audiences—uniting keen viewers and patrons across cities, countries, and time zones.</li>\\n              <li>Further, it’s a way to gain additional revenue through online ticket sales: You can surpass the physical limits of your venue in acquiring audiences who are interested to pay to watch your events. The value placed on a performance in not diminished by live streaming it.</li>\\n            </ul>\\n\\n            <p><strong>What about the audience for physical events / ticket sales? Won’t live streaming make people stay at home rather than attending the event?</strong></p>\\n            <p>A recent case study concluded that 67% of millennials that watch a live stream of a concert are driven to buy tickets for the next upcoming show. Although it can be entertaining and informative to watch an event from home, there are many aspects of the on site experience that just cannot be offered via live streaming.</p>\\n            <p>Live streaming only increases the exposure and reach of the event, and in some cases if it is ticketed online, the revenue of the event. </p>\\n            <p>If physical audience is still a worry, our geoblocking feature helps block local audiences from accessing the livestream and urge them to attend physically while the stream can only be made accessible outside the blocked area. </p>\\n            <p><strong>What happens to artist payments and copyrights?</strong></p>\\n            <ul>\\n              <li>All copyrights remain with the artists or the producer based on their mutual understanding / agreement.</li>\\n              <li>The financials for a premium live stream can be worked out between the host organization / venue and the artiste, based on their mutual agreement again - either a one-time fee or a revenue sharing understanding is the norm. </li>\\n            </ul>\\n\\n            <p><strong>How is this budgeted and what are the additional costs involved?</strong></p>\\n            <p>Shaale charges a fixed one-time fee for the service and will try to recover the amount by offering the event to a worldwide audience online. If Shaale is unable to recover the amount, the producer will be liable to pay only the difference. If the event makes more than the fee, all revenues will be transferred to the producer.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>What is the quality of documentation / livestreaming?</strong></p>\\n            <ul>\\n              <li>HD Livestreaming</li>\\n              <li>Full HD/Ultra HD recording and online archiving</li>\\n              <li>Some audience feedback we have received:</li>\\n            </ul>\\n\\n            <p><strong>Why not stream using a mobile?</strong></p>\\n            <p>Using professional equipment to livestream an event increases brand value, keeps the process formal / official and more than anything maximises audio & video quality to give users unparalleled live experiences. Social media is crowded with content and the only way one can stand out is by providing quality content, clean audio and video.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>We are already streaming events; why collaborate with Shaale?</strong></p>\\n            <p><strong>REACH -</strong> Streaming with Shaale shall amplify the reach to your events amongst a niche global network of artists, scholars, performers & connoisseurs of Indian arts & literature. We take special care to publicise and market each event we stream to targeted lists over email & social media.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>TEAM -</strong> Our on ground video teams are well-acquainted with the nuances and subtleties of Indian performing arts and are specially trained in documentation. We understand how documenting and live streaming Indian arts needs a trained eye and ear and this makes a big difference to the quality of the experience.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>PROVEN TRACK RECORD -</strong> We have worked with over <strong>800 clients</strong> on over <strong>3000 events,</strong> and have generated more than <strong>20,000 hours of content</strong> up to now.</p>\\n            <p><strong>WIN - WIN -</strong> With our premium live streaming platform, we have enabled audiences worldwide to enjoy high-quality performances by eminent artistes, and simultaneously helped artistes / producers to successfully monetize their events and reach a wider, global audience</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>Why will audience back in India watch an event of an Indian performing at London?</strong></p>\\n            <p>Talented and well-known performers have a keen audience across the world. Any concert or performance by them is an opportunity for fans to experience their art. Connoisseurs of the arts seek out quality concerts/events, wherever they are. When they can access events that are not geographically proximate or local for them, it gives them more opportunities to experience the arts, which is what they seek. Through our live streaming platform, we connect a global audience (not just Indian) to events/performances in Indian art forms. Across the world there are people interested in the arts, and specifically in Indian art forms – a diaspora audience as well as an international one.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>I’m concerned that if there is ease of access, people will get used to it and not attend concerts.</strong></p>\\n            <p>Live streaming provides access to concerts where hitherto access was impossible. A rasika or connoisseur sitting in a town in Ireland might love to watch say, a Kuchipudi performance, but owing to there being no events held locally, have no opportunities to do so. This is the gap we are bridging.</p>\\n            <p>But even before that, live streaming improves visibility and awareness. People can’t attend a concert they know nothing about. With people spending so much time online on various devices, the likelihood of coming across a live stream link or social media post – and that being the first information of a concert taking place is high. It helps spread the word about the concert.</p>\\n            <p>Our Geoblocking feature helps ensure that the concert-attending habit is preserved by restricting live stream access to individuals who are in the same city as the physical venue, encouraging them to attend it live instead.</p>\\n            <p><strong>How will livestreaming work with differing viewer time zones?</strong></p>\\n            <p>While a live stream is, by definition, a “live” viewing experience, our offering doesn’t end there. We host a high-quality video recording of the event as video-on-demand (VOD) as soon as the live performance is complete. This VOD stays accessible until the producer wants it removed (for free events) and typically for a week if its a premium / online ticketed event. It gives viewers the option and ease of choosing when they want to watch it, based on their convenience.</p>\\n            <p>This value-add in fact, significantly enhances the prospects of a live event. If an event is not live streamed, then only those who can attend the performance at the designated time at the venue can enjoy it. But live streaming on the Shaale platform gives people across cities, countries, and time zones the access to performances taking place in one corner of the world – and enjoy it at a time and place convenient to them.</p>\\n            <p><strong>Improvised vs static / rehearsed content - What suits a Livestream better?</strong></p>\\n            <p><strong>Both</strong></p>\\n            <p><strong>Pros and cons of Geoblocking</strong></p>\\n            <p>Pro: We are offering our live streaming platform to make art and culture events more accessible and help to preserve them. A chief factor in sustaining the arts is the support of an audience. We don’t want to compromise the physical audience at a venue or dilute the concert-attending habit. By using the Geoblocking feature, access to the premium live stream is available only to viewers outside the geography you command—your city, for instance. This way, those keen to watch the event can enjoy it only at the venue; the potential size of the physical audience at the event is preserved.</p>\\n            <p>Con: The only drawback to Geoblocking is that there are likely to be people interested to attend an event but who may be bogged down by logistical concerns and schedule conflicts in in big cities like Bengaluru (traffic for instance make commutes difficult). However, the Geoblocking feature exists because we want to encourage the habit of attending concerts/events.</p>\\n            <p>For those with a genuine logistical problem in attending the physical venue but real interest in the event, our live streaming platform aims to bridge the gap. The archived video recording of the event is uploaded on Shaale Live as a video-on-demand (VOD) as soon as the live performance is complete. This VOD stays accessible typically for a week after the event. We recommend removing Geoblocking once the event is complete. This way, the physical audience was not compromised to begin with, those who missed attending the event in their city can still enjoy it, and the artiste/organizer can clock more revenues through ticket sales for the VOD.</p>\\n            <p><strong>Should we stream well-known artists or upcoming artists?</strong></p>\\n            <p>Both! Well-known artistes would naturally draw more eyeballs as their reputation precedes them.</p>\\n            <p>If upcoming artistes are performing a unique concept or themed event, that would also be attractive to an online audience. Lastly, an event lineup that combines upcoming artistes with acclaimed ones would be well-positioned to attract viewers while also providing a platform for upcoming artistes to build a new following.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n            <h2>Shaale Courses</h2>\\n\\n            <p><strong>What is Shaale Courses?</strong></p>\\n            <p>Shaale Courses offers learning material on traditional Indian arts & literature in the form of online courses.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>Why subscribe?</strong></p>\\n            <p>The subscription gives you access to our growing library of exclusive courses, featuring the most revered Gurus of our times.</p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>How do I subscribe?</strong></p>\\n            <p>Click on \\\"Pricing\\\" in the header, choose your plan (Monthly or Yearly), make payment using your credit card / debit card / netbaking. </p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>What are the modes of Payment you accept?</strong></p>\\n            <p>If you are trying to buy a subscription from within India, we accept Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Netbanking, Major Digital Wallets & UPI via Instamojo.</p>\\n            <p>If outside India we accept all major credit & debit cards via PayPal. </p>\\n\\n            <p><strong>My credit / debit card payment did not go through.
